Finding Strings in Strings

The find method is a built in operation, or method, provided by Python, that operates on strings.

The output of find is the position of the string where the specified sub-string is found.
- first occurrence
- number that gives first position in search string where the target string appears

<search string>.find(<target string>)

If the target string is not found anywhere in the search string, then the output will be -1

Here are some examples (try them yourself in the interpreter):
pythagoras = 'There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is
music in the spacing of the spheres. '
print pythagoras.find('string')
40
print pythagoras[40:]
strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.
print pythagoras.find('T')
0
print pythagoras.find('sphere')
86
print pythagoras[86:]
spheres
print pythagoras.find('algebra')
-1
