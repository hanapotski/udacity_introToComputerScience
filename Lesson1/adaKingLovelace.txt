August Ada King (Video: Ada)

August Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, 1815-1852, was arguably the world's first computer
programmer. Grace Hopper wasn't the first person to think about using computers to do things
other than arithmetic, but Ada probably was. In her 1843 notes on programming the Analytical
Engine, she writes:

It might act upon other things besides number, were objects found whose mutual
fundamental relations could be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and
which should be also susceptible of adaptations to the action of the operating notation and
mechanism of the engineâ€¦

The It King is referring to is the Analytical Engine, a mechanical programmable computer that
Charles Babbage designed. Although he did not succeed in building it in the 1840s, he did have a
design for it, which Ada was thinking about programming to compose music.
