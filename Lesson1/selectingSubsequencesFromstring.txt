Selecting Sub-Sequences from String

You can select a sub-sequence of a string by designating a starting position and an end position.
Python reads the characters positions starting at 0, so that if we consider the string 'udacity'
that has 7 characters, there are 6 positions with 'u' being in the 0 position. 

<string>[<expression>]  a one-character string

<string>[<start expression>:<stop expression>]  a string that is a sub-sequence of the
characters in the string, from the start position up to the character before the stop position. If the start expression is missing, the sub-sequence starts from the beginning of the string; if the stop expression is missing, the sub-sequence
goes to the end of the string.

Examples:

word = 'assume'
print word[3]
u
print word[4:6]
me
print word[4:] - from 4 to end
me
print word[:2] - from beginning to stop-1
as
print word[:] - start from beginning to end, no sense but consistent with syntax
assume

- includes all characters in str starting at position s, ending with position stop-1, stop not included
