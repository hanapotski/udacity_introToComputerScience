Indexing Strings
When you want to select sub-sequences from a string, it is called indexing. Use the square brackets
[] to specify which part of the string you want to select.

string[0] - first letter
string[-1] - last letter

When you try to index a character in a position where there is none, Python produces an error
indicating that the index is out of range:
name = 'Dave'
 print name[4]
IndexError: string index out of range
