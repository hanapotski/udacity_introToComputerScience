Programming
- the core of computer science

A computer is a machine that can execute a program. With the right program, a computer can do
any mechanical computation you can imagine.

A program describes a very precise sequence of steps. Since the computer is just a machine, the
program must give the steps in a way that can be executed mechanically. That is, the program can
be followed without any thought.

A programming language is a language designed for producing computer programs. A good
programming language makes it easy for humans to read and write programs that can be executed
by a computer.

Python is a programming language. The programs that we write in the Python language will be the
input to the Python interpreter, which is a program that runs on the computer. The Python
interpreter reads our programs and executes them by following the rules of the Python language.
