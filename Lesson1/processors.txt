Here's a more detailed explanation of the Python code here: 299792458 100 1.0/1000000000 * 1/2.7 . The first term is the speed of light in meters per second (this is actually exact - a meter is defined as "the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.".

The second term, 100 is the number of centimeters in a meter.

The third term, 1.0/1000000000 is one billionth. (Note that we need the .0 here (or at least 1.) to make Python do floating point division. Otherwise, 1/1000000000 would evaluate to 0.)

So, the first three terms in the product compute the distance in centimeters that light travels in one billionth of a second (or one nanosecond). To compute the number of nanoseconds per cycle for my 2.7 GHz processor, the fourth term is 1 / 2.7. Since there are 2.7 Billion cycles per second, there are 2.7 cycles per nanosecond, and each cycle takes 1 / 2.7 nanoseconds.
