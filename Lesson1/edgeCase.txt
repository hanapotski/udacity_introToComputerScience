For most strings, all of these options would work.


But if s is the '' empty string, then s[0] will cause an error because there is no character at position 0.


This is called an edge case in programming. It's a situation that doesn't come up too often (you usually don't need to use an empty string), but it does happen sometime.


It's easy to forget about edge cases and doing so is a common cause of bugs.
